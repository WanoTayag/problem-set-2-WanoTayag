# Problem Set 2 ‚Äì Wano Tayag

This repository contains geospatial replications of maps from selected development studies, using shapefiles and population or infrastructure data across four countries. It is part of the final output for Econ 138: Data Science for Economists.

---

## Replicated Studies

The maps replicate data visualizations from the following studies:

- **Mettetal (2019)** ‚Äì *Hydrodams in South Africa: Population Density Analysis*
- **Fried & Lagakos (2021)** ‚Äì *Ethiopian Population Density and ERSS Villages*
- **Balboni (2025)** ‚Äì *Vietnam's Road Types and Infrastructure*
- **Morten & Oliveira (2024)** ‚Äì *Brazil‚Äôs Capital and Main Road Network*

Each visualization was created using GIS techniques via GeoPandas and Matplotlib in Python.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.9+
- `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `contextily`, `shapely`, `pandas`
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

- File paths in the notebook use relative paths.
- If using different local paths, modify the `base_path` variables accordingly.
- Maps were recreated for academic and visualization practice only.
